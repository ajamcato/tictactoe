## Planning Story

My first approach to the project focused solely on building out the API which consisted of the authentification forms and the game API. After completing the API's, I moved on to develop the game logic. For the first day of the project, I wanted to make certain the
authentification forms were working correctly before moving on to create the game logic.

#### Wins, Frustrations, What I could've done differently...

The first initiative I took when creating the game logic was to switch players between the X and O. With that being said, I used an if statement to change between players, with a notification that lets the user know whose turn it is. I had difficulties trying to implement code to switch between players, it took me a few hours to figure out what the bugs were, but while working with my instructors and peers, I was able to debug the code, which was a great win for me. Some of my frustrations stemmed from creating the game logic, it was the most challenging part of the project.

The advice I would give myself for future projects would be to break down the bigger problems into smaller ones. To accomplish this, I will write down each step in pseudo code before diving into the code.

## User Stories
